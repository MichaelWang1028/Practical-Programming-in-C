# Practical-Programming-in-C
I have decided to improve my knowledge in C, so I have started this course which has been totally amazing.
I highly recommend to take this course for the ones who are interested in learning about C.
This course has been very challenging, and the problem sets and projects are really pragmatic.

When I started learning about C, I was reading a really good book: Head First C which sincerely is an excellent book.
However, this book does not offer challenging problems or exercises, so I started to look for a course to fill these requirements, and fortunately I found this at MIT OpenCourseWare.

The purpose of this README is to track how well (or badly) I am doing this course, and I would also like to provide some advice for the ones who are interested in taking this course too.
Therefore, for every lecture, I will include a brief summary, while for every project or problem set I will describe the difficulties and insights I got.

## Problem Set 6 - Part A
### Pointers to pointers. Multidimensional arrays. Stacks and Queues.
